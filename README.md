# IT3046C-17SS-Lab-3

### Lab Goals

1. Demonstrate understanding of basic DOM manipulation
2. Demonstrate understanding of simple functions
3. Demonstrate understanding of simple loops

### Instructions

For this lab you will demonstrate basic understanding of JavaScript functions, loops, and DOM manipulation by creating elements with JavaScript using a provided array of strings.
Fork the provided seed (https://github.uc.edu/livelyar/IT3046C-17SS-Lab-3) as a starting point.  While this project is pretty simple now, we will be building off from this base throughout the rest of the semester.  You can use plain old JavaScript or jQuery for this lab, your choice.  The HTML and JS files are already created for you and linked up, you just need to implement the TODOs in the ContactTable.js file.
